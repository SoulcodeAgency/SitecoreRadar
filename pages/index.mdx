The latest version of the **[Sitecore Radar](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sitecore-radar.com%2Fradar%2Flatest%2FSitecore%20Radar.csv)** is hosted by Thoughtworks and generated out of the Blips from the Sitecore Radar [repository](https://github.com/SoulcodeAgency/SitecoreRadar). Contributions are welcome!
## The Blog

Major updates to the Sitecore Radar and content that might not age well is published through our new [blog](/blog).

The Sitecore ecosystem is changing at an ever faster pace and we felt the radar visualization alone does not suite for all the details we'd like to share. So we created this full documentation site.
