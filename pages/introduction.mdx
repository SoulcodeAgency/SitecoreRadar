# What is the Sitecore Radar?

> The Sitecore Radar aims at providing an orientation for technologists interested in the Sitecore ecosystem. From products to modules, tools and libraries as well as techniques, the radar covers what's hot and what's not.

If you've just been introduced to Sitecore, the ecosystem might be overwhelming. With a wide range of products and modules by Sitecore itself, but also the big amount of community contributions, it is tough to find out what's available, what's here to stay and what's already past its expected life cycle.

But even if you've been using and working with Sitecore for a while, the ever changing offerings and new community contributions might be unheard to you and you'd welcome an orientation on where you might run into technical dept and where you could benefit from a change in your Sitecore stack.

The Sitecore Radar is an interactive documentation of things that are relevant in the Sitecore ecosystem today. The radar changes over time, gets updates and new releases. It is a documentation based on experiences we've made in the field and while the documentation as such aims to be relevant, objectively correct and up to date, the classification is certainly debatable. That's why we like to call it an opinionated radar.

## Blips and Quadrants

Each item (also known as _Blip_) is added to the radar in exactly one out of four categories - the so-called quadrants on the radar.

## Rings

Additionally, every Blip is also classified into one out of four Rings that provide some insights on the current state of a Blip and puts it into competitive relation with other Blips from the same quadrant.

Last but not least the Sitecore Radar also supports the differentiation of _new_ or _moved_ Blips (triangle shape) versus Blips with _no changes_ (round shape).

## Blip Details

You can select a Blip from the list on the side of the radar to learn more about the Blip. We've tried to keep the structure of the description consistent and provide you with links to documentation and project sources.
