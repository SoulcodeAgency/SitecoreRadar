After creating the first version of the Sitecore Radar, I realized that the visualization of the radar did not meet all the requirements I had to publish content.

- the Radar UI from Thoughtworks has only poor mobile support
- further details on a Blip and more in-depth content is hard to pack into the space available
- UI customizings are very limited

I therefore looked out for an additional format to publish extended content. So, here we are now, with the first version of the [dockz](https://github.com/remorses/dokz) based documentation site.

Feedback, ideas and inputs are very welcome as always, preferably by creating a [Github issue](https://github.com/SoulcodeAgency/SitecoreRadar/issues/new).
