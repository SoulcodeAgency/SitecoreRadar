# Sitecore Radar

[*Show me the Sitecore Radar!*]()

## About

The Sitecore Radar is inspired by Thoughtworks popular Technology Radar. Here's a short intro to some of the key ideas.
Most of the content is borrowed directly from the [faq page](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq) over at Thoughworks.

### What's the Structure of the Radar

The Radar is all about tracking interesting things, which are refered to as blips. Blips are organized onto the Radar using two categorizing elements: the _quadrants_ and the _rings_. The quadrants represent different kinds of blips. The rings indicate what stage in an adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.

### What are Quadrants?

The quadrants are a categorization of the type of blips:

* Techniques
* Modules
* Product
* Tools & Libraries

### What counts as a blip?

A blip is a technology or technique that plays a role in the Sitecore ecosystem. Blips are things that are ‘in motion’ - that is we find their position in the Radar is changing - usually indicating that we’re finding increasing confidence in them as they move through the rings.
