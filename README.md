## About

The Sitecore Radar is inspired by Thoughtworks popular Technology Radar. Here's a short intro to some of the key ideas.
Most of the content is borrowed directly from the [faq page](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq) over at Thoughworks.

### What's the Structure of the Radar

The Radar is all about tracking interesting things, which are refered to as blips. Blips are organized onto the Radar using two categorizing elements: the _quadrants_ and the _rings_. The quadrants represent different kinds of blips. The rings indicate what stage in an adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.

### What are Quadrants

The quadrants are a categorization of the type of blips:

* **Techniques**: Things that can be applied while working with Sitecore, like applying structure to the software or following design guidelines (like Helix).
* **Modules**: Under Modules we explicitly categorize 3rd party components that can be installed/deployed to a Sitecore product and enhances its features.
* **Product**: All software available from Sitecore except for the content management core (Experience Management). We assume that the quadrant might be a guidence for people already working with Sitecore and as of today the "default" minimal viable Sitecore product is the Sitecore Experience Management.
* **Tools & Libraries**: Software that are generally not deployed to/with Sitecore to enhance business features, but software that enhances the development experience with Sitecore.

### What counts as a Blip

A blip is a technology or technique that plays a role in the Sitecore ecosystem. Blips are things that are ‘in motion’ - that is we find their position in the Radar is changing - usually indicating that we’re finding increasing confidence in them as they move through the rings.

## Contributing

Please do! Pull requests are welcome. If you'd like to add a new blip to the radar, please create an issue first to discuss the addition.
