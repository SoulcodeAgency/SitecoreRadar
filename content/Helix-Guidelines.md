The [Helix Guidelines](https://helix.sitecore.com/) should not require an introduction anymore. It is the defacto standard for Sitecore developers to structure, architect and build Solutions.

We consider adhering to the Helix guidelines as much as possible and discussing deviations in the team a valuable process. Sometimes better solution arise from discussions, sometimes not. And in this case, breaking the Helix guidelines is eventually ok as long as the [technical dept is documented and the team is aware of it](https://helix.sitecore.com/appendix/alternate-visual-studio-structures.html#does-sitecore-helix-really-allow-this).

We've put the Helix guidelines in _Adopt_ ring, of course.
