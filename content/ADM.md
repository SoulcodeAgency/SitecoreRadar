[Analytics Database Manager](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/A/Analytics_Database_Manager.aspx) is 
around since early versions of Sitecore Analytics (OMS). ADM covers an important, but lacking feature in 
Sitecores Analytics: Removing contacts (and their interactions) from the database.

It is developed and maintained by Sitecore employees and the authors can be contacted directly via E-Mail. 
Although available on the Marketplace and initially published on Github, the current version is still free, 
but not open source.
