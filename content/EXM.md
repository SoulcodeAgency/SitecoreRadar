The [Sitecore E-Email Experience Manager (EXM)](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/exm/100/email-experience-manager/en/index-en.html) is Sitecores' fully integrated e-mail marketing solution.

EXM provides not only the editing interface known from the content management solution, it is also integrated into the List Manager and Marketing Automation for automated mailings. With access to the Experience Profiles EXM supports personalized and multivariant testing and comes with performance reports to measure the success of your campaigns. With version 10 Sitecore includes a new set of templates ready to be customized for a faster implementation.

EXM has undergone many renovations since its integration into the core product and although it still has its glitches it's a very effective solution to get up and running with personalized, relevant multi-channel communication with your customers. Be aware that Sitecore requires you to license EXM separately although it comes with the core product.

With the latest updates we think EXM is ready for the _Adopt_ ring. If you've invested in full Experience Platform, using EXM for your mailings is at hand.
