[Sitecore Powershell Extensions](https://doc.sitecorepowershell.com/) provides a web-based powershell scripting interface and exposes the Sitecore API (mostly for content) to powershell.

The module also ships with a good amount of pre-built scripts to analyse, report and manage data in Sitecore. It provides easy to use extension points to build user input dialogs, hook into the content editor via different menues available or simply run ad-hoc scripts against the Sitecore API.
SPE also provides a nice API over HTTP for automations during continuous integration and deployment.

We've put Sitecore Powersehll Extensions in the _Adopt_ ring and think it's an invaluable extension to Sitecore that should not miss from any Sitecore instance.
