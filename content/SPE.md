[Sitecore Powershell Extensions](https://doc.sitecorepowershell.com/) is part if almost every Sitecore 
installation today. Due to the dependency of Sitecore SXA on this module, this is not of a bit surprise. But 
regardless of having SXA running on your Sitecore instance the SPE module is an invaluable tool for many 
content automations and author extensions.

SPE also provides a nice API for automations during CI and deployment.
