[Glass Mapper](https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper/) is an object-relational mapping library for Sitecore. It maps the items and its fields to strongly typed objects and properties. 

Glass Mapper has made ORMs and wrappers popular for Sitecore and is a prooven and solid solution running on many Sitecore instances around the globe. 

Version 5 of Glass Mapper introduced many breaking changes and made upgrades from earlier versions a costly investment on larger solutions. More than ever it is absolutely crucial to have good knowledge of the inner workings of the framework to not get trapped in performance pitfalls.

We see Glass Mapper in the _Hold_ ring as we think there are valid options available that are lightweight and closer to the Sitecore API.
