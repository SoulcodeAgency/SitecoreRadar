[Dianoga](https://github.com/kamsar/Dianoga) is the must-have module if you intend to serve image out of the 
Sitecore Media Library since its version 5 released earlier in 2020.

It provides support for optimized, compressed images and supports the efficient modern image format _Webp_. 
It's installation and setup is straight forward and usually does not interfere with any of your custom 
implementations.
