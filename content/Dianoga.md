[Dianoga](https://github.com/kamsar/Dianoga) adds improved image optimization and compression to images served out of the media library.

Dianoga has been around for a while, but only since its v5 release has robust support for serving _Webp_ images to modern browsers (converted out of jpeg) and also has proven support for an integration with any CDN of your choice.

Setup and integration is straight forward, especially with IaaS setups, but it also works on Azure PaaS. In case you're already extending the media-request handler, you can get integrate the few lines of code for Dianoga into your custom Sitecore solution.

We think Dianoga is one of the few must-have modules for Sitecore and thus think it deserves a place in the _Adopt_ ring.
