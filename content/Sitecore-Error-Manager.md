[Sitecore Error Manager](https://github.com/unic/SitecoreErrorManager) is around since Version 6 of Sitecore 
and covers almost all 404 and other error page scenarios in a robust and Sitecore-like way. With its support 
for context-aware multisite enabled custom error pages, it has become a default go-to module for many 
implementations as of today.

That said, development of the module seems to be held at a minimum to keep it compatible with newer versions 
of Sitecore.
