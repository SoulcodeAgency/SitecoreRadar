Dianoga,Adopt,Modules,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/kamsar/Dianoga"">Dianoga</a> adds improved image optimization and compression to images served out of the media library.</p><p>Dianoga has been around for a while, but only since its v5 release has robust support for serving <em>Webp</em> images to modern browsers (converted out of jpeg) and also has proven support for an integration with any CDN of your choice.</p><p>Setup and integration is straight forward, especially with IaaS setups, but it also works on Azure PaaS. In case you're already extending the media-request handler, you can get integrate the few lines of code for Dianoga into your custom Sitecore solution.</p><p>We think Dianoga is one of the few must-have modules for Sitecore and thus think it deserves a place in the <em>Adopt</em> ring.</p>"
E-Mail Experience Manager,Adopt,Products,TRUE,"<p>The <a href=""https://doc.sitecore.com/users/exm/100/email-experience-manager/en/index-en.html"">Sitecore E-Email Experience Manager (EXM)</a> is Sitecores' fully integrated e-mail marketing solution.</p><p>EXM provides not only the editing interface known from the content management solution, it is also integrated into the List Manager and Marketing Automation for automated mailings. With access to the Experience Profiles, EXM supports personalized and multivariant testing and comes with performance reports to measure the success of your campaigns. With version 10 Sitecore includes a new set of templates ready to be customized for a faster implementation.</p><p>EXM has undergone many renovations since its integration into the core product and although it still has its glitches it's a very effective solution to get up and running with personalized, relevant multi-channel communication with your customers. Be aware that Sitecore requires you to license EXM separately although it comes with the core product.</p><p>With the latest updates we think EXM is ready for the <em>Adopt</em> ring. If you've invested in full Experience Platform, using EXM for your mailings is at hand.</p>"
Sitecore Powershell Extensions,Adopt,Modules,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://doc.sitecorepowershell.com/"">Sitecore Powershell Extensions</a> provides a web-based powershell scripting interface and exposes the Sitecore API (mostly for content) to powershell.</p><p>The module also ships with a good amount of pre-built scripts to analyse, report and manage data in Sitecore. It provides easy to use extension points to build user input dialogs, hook into the content editor via different menues available or simply run ad-hoc scripts against the Sitecore API.SPE also provides a nice API over HTTP for automations during continuous integration and deployment.</p><p>We've put Sitecore Powersehll Extensions in the <em>Adopt</em> ring and think it's an invaluable extension to Sitecore that should not miss from any Sitecore instance.</p>"
Sitecore Error Manager,Adopt,Modules,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/unic/SitecoreErrorManager"">Sitecore Error Manager</a> extends Sitecore with a context-aware error handling with a main focus on user and SEO friendly page not found (404) pages.</p><p>The module supports a multi-site, multi-language setup and covers the https errors that typically require friendly feedback to users like page not found or access denied. It also supports custom error messages for assets and generally comes with a variety of configuration options.</p><p>The Sitecore Error Manager is a mature, with support for Sitecore versions up to 9.3 as of this writing. That said, development of the module seems to be held at a minimum to keep it compatible with newer versions of Sitecore. Be aware that the module does not support JSS/headless scenarios.</p><p>We've assigned the module to the <em>Adopt</em> circle, as we still see a relevant amount of deployments running it with MVC based presentation layers.</p>"
Synthesis,Adopt,Tools-And-Libraries,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/blipson89/Synthesis"">Synthesis</a> is an item wrapper for Sitecore and provides auto-generated<sup>1</sup> interfaces for item templates and a native integration into the ContentSearch API.</p><p>As Synthesis is not an ORM (like for example Glass Mapper), but rather wraps itself around the Sitecore Item. Synthesis does not add much overhead, is very fast and has a relatively low learning curve. Thanks to a pre-configured code-generation setup with <a href=""https://github.com/blipson89/Leprechaun"">Leprechaun</a>, Synthesis requires almost no boilerplating and no framework specific runtime configurations.</p><p>Unfortunately Synthesis is lacking support for parameter templates, so you'll have to either write your own extension or use the native Sitecore API for parameter templates.</p>"
Analytics Database Manager,Trial,Modules,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/A/Analytics_Database_Manager.aspx"">Analytics Database Manager</a> extends Sitecore xConnect data management capabilities by adding a couple of data removal options.</p><p>ADM is around since early versions of Sitecore Analytics (OMS) and still then provides a solution to remove historical data from the analytics database in Sitecore. This is especially usefull since storage consumption is quite excessive on high traffic sites.</p><p>With the latest version ADM supports Sitecore 9.3. and provides the following main features:</p><ul><li>removal of historical data (with a cut off date provided)</li><li>removal of single contacts (useful to support the GDPR process and its ""right to be forgotten"")</li><li>remove contacts with no interactions after a specified date</li></ul><p>While ADM actually started as an open source project on Github, it is no longer maintained in the public, which is a pitty. That said, the friendly maintainers at Sitecore can be reached via e-mail and are happy to receive feedback on the module.</p><p>We've put ADM into the <em>Trial</em> ring to encourage its use when data retention policies on the xConnect databases are due. And we see increasing demand in reducing the amount of data stored in xConnect.</p>"
Horizon,Assess,Products,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://doc.sitecore.com/users/100/sitecore-experience-platform/en/horizon.html"">Horizon</a> is the newest editing interface provided by Sitecore and at some point in the future is going to replace the Content Editor and the Experience Editor as the main editor.</p><p>Horizon provides an easy to use editing interface for authors. Currently suited best for authoring roles with rather limited editing rights. The version available with Sitecore 10 has multi-site and multi-language support but is still lacking many of the features of the standard editing interfaces. Horizon is a .Net Core based standalone application that must be installed along side the Sitecore CM instance (similar to Identity Server) and integrates with the Sitecore content management server through iFrames and REST API.</p><p>Having an author friendly editing interface that integrates with the data service through a headless backend is a good thing. It allows Sitecore to also ""unwire"" the monolythic Sitecore Kernel and its many UIs surrounding it (ContentEditor, ExperienceEditor, SPEAK apps). That said, keep in mind that the current version still lacks many features of the existing editor tooling and cannot be considered a replacement in every case. But it might be the easy to use editor you've been looking for to introduce to your editors. Review your editing requirements to see if Horizon is ready for you.</p><p>Horizon is most likely here to stay and receives updates in the next releases, we therefore put it in the <em>Assess</em> ring.</p>"
Glass Mapper,Hold,Tools-And-Libraries,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper/"">Glass Mapper</a> is an object-relational mapping library for Sitecore. It maps the items and its fields to strongly typed objects and properties. </p><p>Glass Mapper has made ORMs and wrappers popular for Sitecore and is a proven and solid solution running on many Sitecore instances around the globe. </p><p>Version 5 of Glass Mapper introduced many breaking changes and made upgrades from earlier versions a costly investment on larger solutions. More than ever it is absolutely crucial to have good knowledge of the inner workings of the framework to not get trapped in performance pitfalls.</p><p>We see Glass Mapper in the <em>Hold</em> ring as we think there are valid options available that are lightweight and closer to the Sitecore API.</p>"
